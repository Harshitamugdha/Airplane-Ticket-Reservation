Getting Started
To run this project locally on your machine:

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlyAway-Airlines.git
2.Navigate to the project folder:
cd FlyAway-Airlines
3.Open the index.html file in your browser:
You can simply double-click the index.html file, or you can open it in a code editor like VS Code and use the live server extension to view it in the browser.
Running the Project
There is no server-side functionality for this project (as it's a static website), so you can run it directly by opening the index.html file in any modern web browser. The website is fully responsive and will adjust for both desktop and mobile devices.

Features
Home Page: Learn more about the airline and why it's a top choice for travelers.
Booking Flights: The user can book flights by entering the origin, destination, date, and number of passengers. The form will later be enhanced for real-time flight availability (if connected to a database).
Contact Us: Reach out to FlyAway Airlines' support team for inquiries or help.
Development and Contribution

Known Issues
No Backend Integration: The current project is a static website, and the form submissions do not store or send data to a server.
Flight Availability: The reservation form is static and doesn't fetch real-time flight availability data. Future versions could include dynamic flight search functionality using APIs.
Future Features
Backend Integration: Add a server-side backend with user authentication, real-time flight search, and payment processing.
API Integration: Integrate with an API to show live flight information, booking, and payment processing.
